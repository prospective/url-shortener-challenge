Please develop an application which fulfills the requirements described below. Push your code to your github profile (*PRIVATE Repository*) and invite following users to the repo.

* link:https://github.com/borisstock[borisstock]
* link:https://github.com/ehinterberger[ehinterberger]

== Functional Requirements

* [ ] An application which exposes one endpoint (MUST be a REST endpoint) to shorten a url. The backend responds with a shortened url.
* [ ] If the shortened URL will be called, the application performs a redirect to the registered URL.
* [ ] The registered URL SHOULD be persisted to survive application restarts.

== Non-Functional Requirements

* [ ] MUST use Spring Boot
* [ ] MUST use a build tool. _Use a tool, you're familiar with._
* [ ] Required services MUST be containerized. MAY be a docker container.
* [ ] The application itself MUST be containerized. MAY be a docker container.
* [ ] The project MAY be able to start (not built) with only one command.
* [ ] The business layer MUST contain minimum ONE meaningful test (the covereage is not essential)
* [ ] Postgres MAY be used as persistent storage layer.

== Bonus

* [ ] A client MAY provide a TTL Information for a new URL shorten request.
* [ ] If the TTL for a given URL is reached, the URL will be removed from the persistent storage.
