Please develop an application which fulfills the requirements described below. Push your code to your github profile (*PRIVATE Repository*) and invite following users to the repo.

* link:https://github.com/borisstock[borisstock]

== Functional Requirements

* [ ] An application which exposes one endpoint (MUST be a REST endpoint) to shorten a url. The backend responds with a shortened URL.
* [ ] If the shortened URL will be called by a caller, the application performs a redirect to the registered URL.
* [ ] The registered URL MUST be persisted to survive application restarts.
* [ ] Each click event on the shortened URL MUST be counted and stored with the fields (`timestamp`, `IP`, `user agent`, `referrer`). Ideally an aspect (AOP) will be used to instrument the endpoint to count the clicks.
* [ ] The application MUST provide an endpoint to retrieve the click events for a given shortened URL. The response MUST contain aggregated values (e.g. per `hour` or `day`) and SHOULD not contain the plain click events.
* [ ] The application SHOULD NOT provide a user interface (UI). Only a REST API is required.

== Non-Functional Requirements

* [ ] MUST use Spring Boot
* [ ] MUST use a build tool. _Use a tool, you're familiar with._
* [ ] Required services MUST be containerized. MAY be a docker container.
* [ ] The application itself MUST be containerized. MAY be a docker container.
* [ ] The project SHOULD be able to start with only one command (regardless of the dev setup).
* [ ] The business layer MUST contain minimum ONE meaningful test (the coverage is not essential).
* [ ] A relational database MAY be used to persist the data.

== Bonus (Optional)

* [ ] A client MAY provide a TTL Information for a new URL shorten request.
* [ ] If the TTL for a given URL is reached, the URL will be removed from the persistent storage.
